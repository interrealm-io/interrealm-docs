# Recursive AI: The LoopStack Architecture

**Author: InterRealm Team ‚Äî October 2025**

---

## Abstract

**Recursive AI** introduces a new paradigm in distributed, decentralized intelligence ‚Äî one where autonomous agents coordinate, recurse, and evolve through a structure known as the **LoopStack**.

A LoopStack abstracts recursive, dynamic, and emergent intelligence into a modular framework, enabling continuously cascading AI processes at global scale.

At its essence, a LoopStack is a *recursive AI call stack* ‚Äî a foundational schema that defines how intelligent loops spawn, cascade, and coordinate across networks of agents without central orchestration. This architecture promotes **continuously cascading AI** ‚Äî a living system of recursive computation and coordination we call **LoopStacks at Internet scale**.

## What You're Building: Continuously Cascading AI

When the **InterRealm** scales globally, the LoopStack architecture allows for:

- **Loops spawning across organizations**
- **Sub-loops cascading** to whoever holds capability
- **Results aggregating back upward** through recursive hierarchies
- **Continuous, distributed, recursive coordination** across the network

This results in a continuously evolving ecosystem of autonomous agents, co-creating and coordinating knowledge at planetary scale.

## What Is a LoopStack?

A **LoopStack** is an **Agentic Recursive AI Stack** ‚Äî a distributed, dynamic framework where loops (intelligent tasks) interact recursively through defined schemas.

### Core Structure

A LoopStack defines:

- **Input schema** ‚Äî the data or signal required to initialize the process
- **Output schema** ‚Äî the structure of the results it produces
- **Stacked loops** ‚Äî a sequence of intelligent loops, each with defined input/output schemas and behaviors

Each **loop** in a stack has a *recruitment and initialization phase*, during which it:

1. **Broadcasts a loop start notification** to the network
2. **Aggregates a set of agents** capable of contributing based on the loop's type and requirements

Loop types may include:

- **Aggregation loops** (bidding, voting, consensus)
- **Contribution loops** (collaborative problem-solving)
- **Delegation loops** (spawning sub-loops for deeper recursion)

## Dynamic Recursion and Distributed Intelligence

Unlike fixed workflows, a LoopStack is a **foundation blueprint** for **dynamic, extendable runtime behavior**.
Loops can:

- Operate **asynchronously** or **synchronously**, with configurable timeouts for coordination
- **Recruit agents dynamically** based on capability and context
- **Spawn sub-LoopStacks** within their execution phase

When a loop spawns a sub-LoopStack, **recursion occurs** ‚Äî the process repeats at a deeper layer.
This recursive cascade produces emergent intelligence through continuous self-coordination.

## The Power of the LoopStack

The LoopStack architecture transforms coordination into computation.
Its recursive nature enables:

- üß† **Emergent intelligence** ‚Äî new patterns and solutions forming from nested interactions
- üåê **Global participation** ‚Äî any capable agent, anywhere, can contribute dynamically
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Decentralized orchestration** ‚Äî no central control, yet coherent global behavior emerges
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Living systems** ‚Äî self-sustaining AI processes that learn, adapt, and recurse indefinitely

---

## In Summary

LoopStacks are not static pipelines ‚Äî they are *living recursive systems*.
Each LoopStack acts as both a **schema** and a **protocol** for recursive, agentic collaboration.

When deployed across networks, they enable **Continuously Cascading AI** ‚Äî a vision of distributed, emergent intelligence operating at **Internet scale**.
