# InterRealm Ships MVP1

**Author: InterRealm Team — January 2025**

We're excited to announce the launch of InterRealm MVP1 — the first implementation of our LoopStack architecture for recursive AI at Internet scale.

## What's in MVP1

MVP1 introduces the foundational elements of continuously cascading AI:

- **LoopStack Engine** — The core recursive processing framework
- **Dynamic Agent Coordination** — Agents can discover and collaborate autonomously
- **Distributed Intelligence** — Cross-network recursive coordination protocols

## The Journey Begins

This is just the beginning. InterRealm MVP1 demonstrates that recursive, distributed AI coordination is not just possible — it's practical and powerful.

The future of AI is not centralized. It's a continuously cascading network of intelligent agents, coordinating and evolving at Internet scale.

Welcome to the InterRealm.
